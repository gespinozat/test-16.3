A project's repository name defines its URL and its place on the file disk
where GitLab is installed.

Prerequisites:

You must be a project maintainer, owner, or administrator to rename a repository.

NOTE:
When you change the repository path, users may experience issues if they push to, or pull from, the old URL. For more information, see
[redirects when renaming repositories](../repository/index.md#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes).

To rename a repository:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the **Change path** text box, edit the path.
1. Select **Change path**.

## Delete the source branch on merge by default

In merge requests, you can change the default behavior so that the
**Delete the source branch** checkbox is always selected.

To set this default:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Merge requests**.
1. Select **Enable "Delete source branch" option by default**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Transfer a project to another namespace

When you transfer a project to another namespace, you move the project to a different group.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the [group](../../group/index.md#create-a-group) to which you are transferring.
- You must be the Owner of the project you transfer.
- The group must allow creation of new projects.
- The project must not contain any [container images](../../packages/container_registry/index.md#move-or-rename-container-registry-repositories).
- Remove any npm packages. If you transfer a project to a different root namespace, the project must not contain any npm packages. When you update the path of a user or group, or transfer a subgroup or project, you must remove any npm packages first. You cannot update the root namespace of a project with npm packages. Make sure you update your .npmrc files to follow the naming convention and run npm publish if necessary.
- If a security policy is assigned to the project, it is automatically unassigned during the transfer.

To transfer a project:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. Under **Transfer project**, choose the namespace to transfer the project to.
1. Select **Transfer project**.
1. Enter the project's name and select **Confirm**.

You are redirected to the project's new page and GitLab applies a redirect. For more information about repository redirects, see [What happens when a repository path changes](../repository/index.md#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes).

NOTE:
If you are an administrator, you can also use the [administration interface](../../../administration/admin_area.md#administering-projects)
to move any project to any namespace.

### Transferring a GitLab SaaS project to a different subscription tier

When you transfer a project from a namespace licensed for GitLab SaaS Premium or Ultimate to GitLab Free, the following paid feature data is deleted:

- [Project access tokens](../../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md) are revoked
- [Pipeline subscriptions](../../../ci/pipelines/index.md#trigger-a-pipeline-when-an-upstream-project-is-rebuilt)
  and [test cases](../../../ci/test_cases/index.md) are deleted.

## Delete a project

> - Default deletion behavior for projects changed to [delayed project deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32935) in GitLab 12.6.
> - Default deletion behavior for projects changed to [immediate deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220382) in GitLab 13.2.
> - Default deletion behavior for projects on the Premium and Ultimate tier changed to [delayed project deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389557) in GitLab 16.0.
> - Default deletion behavior changed to delayed deletion on the Premium and Ultimate tier [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

You can mark a project to be deleted.

Prerequisite:

- You must have the Owner role for a project.

To delete a project:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the **Delete this project** section, select **Delete project**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, enter the project name and select **Yes, delete project**.

This action deletes the project and all associated resources (such as issues and merge requests).

### Delayed project deletion **(PREMIUM ALL)**

> - [Enabled for projects in personal namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/89466) in GitLab 15.1.
> - [Disabled for projects in personal namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95495) in GitLab 15.3.
> - Enabled delayed deletion by default and removed the option to delete immediately [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

Projects in a group (not a personal namespace) can be deleted after a delay period.

On self-managed instances, group administrators can define a deletion delay period of between 1 and 90 days.
On SaaS, there is a non-adjustable default retention period of seven days.

### Delete a project immediately

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/191367) in GitLab 14.1.
> - Option to delete projects immediately from the Admin Area and as a group setting removed [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

If you don't want to wait for delayed deletion, you can delete a project immediately. To do this, perform the steps for [deleting a projects](#delete-a-project) again.

In the first cycle of deleting a project, the project is moved to the delayed deletion queue and automatically deleted after the retention period has passed.
If during this delayed deletion time you run a second deletion cycle, the project is deleted immediately.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for a project.
- You have [marked the project for deletion](#delete-a-project).

To immediately delete a project marked for deletion:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the **Delete this project** section, select **Delete project**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, enter the project name and select **Yes, delete project**.

## Restore a project **(PREMIUM ALL)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32935) in GitLab 12.6.

To restore a project marked for deletion:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** (**{search}**) to find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the Restore project section, select **Restore project**.

## Monitor settings

### Alerts

Configure [alert integrations](../../../operations/incident_management/integrations.md#configuration) to triage and manage critical problems in your application as [alerts](../../../operations/incident_management/alerts.md).

### Incidents

#### Alert integration

Automatically [create](../../../operations/incident_management/alerts.md#trigger-actions-from-alerts), [notify on](../../../operations/incident_management/paging.md#email-notifications-for-alerts), and [resolve](../../../operations/incident_management/manage_incidents.md#automatically-close-incidents-via-recovery-alerts) incidents based on GitLab alerts.

#### PagerDuty integration

[Create incidents in GitLab for each PagerDuty incident](../../../operations/incident_management/manage_incidents.md#using-the-pagerduty-webhook).

#### Incident settings

[Manage Service Level Agreements for incidents](../../../operations/incident_management/incidents.md#service-level-agreement-countdown-timer) with an SLA countdown timer.

### Error Tracking

Configure Error Tracking to discover and view [Sentry errors within GitLab](../../../operations/error_tracking.md).

### Status Page **(ULTIMATE ALL)**

[Add Storage credentials](../../../operations/incident_management/status_page.md#sync-incidents-to-the-status-page)
to enable the syncing of public Issues to a [deployed status page](../../../operations/incident_management/status_page.md#create-a-status-page-project).

## Troubleshooting

When working with project settings, you might encounter the following issues, or require alternate methods to complete specific tasks.

### Transfer a project through console

If transferring a project through the UI or API is not working, you can attempt the transfer in a [Rails console session](../../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).

```ruby
p = Project.find_by_full_path('<project_path>')

# To set the owner of the project
current_user = p.creator

# Namespace where you want this to be moved
namespace = Namespace.find_by_full_path("<new_namespace>")

Projects::TransferService.new(p, current_user).execute(namespace)
```
